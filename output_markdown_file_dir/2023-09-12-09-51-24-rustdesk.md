Some time ago, an old MacBook Pro was transformed by me into a film and television resource decoding host, ["Raspberry Pi Doesn't Collect Dust" Issue 17: Building an open-source and free jellyfin private cinema with Raspberry Pi and a better-performing idle laptop](https://v2fy.com/p/2023-06-10-jellyfin-1686388142000/), I wanted to access this MacBook Pro via remote desktop. Although macOS natively supports VNC connections, the experience often involved screen tearing. Therefore, I looked for an open-source remote desktop program, rustdesk, and deployed its service on a Raspberry Pi, achieving silky smooth access for LAN devices and direct access for WAN devices through network penetration.

rustdesk's Github open source address: https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk

## Advantages of rustdesk / Advantages of rustdesk

- Open-source, supports private deployment
- No limit on the number of connections
- Supports Windows, macOS, Linux; one solution for remote control
- Through an internal network mapping scheme, allowing remote control of internal network devices anytime, anywhere
- Silky smooth internal network access, automatically switching between internal and external network traffic

## Deploying rustdesk on a Raspberry Pi to achieve LAN Windows control of macOS

```
# Create a mount directory
mkdir -p /opt/rustdesk
chmod 755 -R /opt/rustdesk
# Create a directory to store docker-compose.yml
mkdir -p /opt/rustdesk-docker-compose-yml
chmod 755 -R /opt/rustdesk-docker-compose-yml
# Create docker-compose.yml
touch /opt/rustdesk-docker-compose-yml/docker-compose.yml 
```

Enter the configuration content in `docker-compose.yml`

```git
cat << 'EOF' > /opt/rustdesk-docker-compose-yml/docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

networks:
  rustdesk-net:
    external: false

services:
  hbbs:

      - 21116:21116/udp
      - 21118:21118

    networks:
      - rustdesk-net
    depends_on:
      - hbbr
    restart: unless-stopped

  hbbr:
    container_name: hbbr
    ports:
      - 21117:21117
      - 21119:21119
    image: rustdesk/rustdesk-server:latest
    command: hbbr
    volumes:
      - /opt/rustdesk:/root
    networks:
      - rustdesk-net
    restart: unless-stopped
EOF
```

- Start the service

```
cd /opt/rustdesk-docker-compose-yml/
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

My Raspberry Pi local network IP is `192.168.50.10`, enter `192.168.50.10` into the rustdesk client (both the initiating and controlled ends need to download, install the rustdesk client, and fill in the ID Server properly), rustdesk client download address: https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases

![image-20230912101426079](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1694484866814RTGS03DK.png)

After the client saves, it will show that the configuration is successful.

After the configuration is completed, we can remotely control devices within the LAN through the rustdesk service running on the Raspberry Pi.

The controlled host's ID will not change (unless the user actively changes it), but the password often randomly changes. If you want to use a fixed password, you can set it directly as shown in the following figures.

Display aspects can be customized. LAN latency can be reduced to 5ms, and controlling macOS with Windows is very responsive and smooth.

One caveat encountered: If the MacBook is closed without an external display, rustdesk often disconnects automatically after a few seconds. If you also want to control a MacBook, please do not close the lid.

## Enabling rustdesk service on a home Raspberry Pi to support WAN access

Accessing over the WAN is actually quite simple, just use FRP to map a few ports.

![image-20230912111138990](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1694488300187hfGn57Qt.png)

- Add the following configuration in the Raspberry Pi's frpc.ini file, and restart frpc.

```
[rustdesk-tcp-21115]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 21115
remote_port = 21115

[rustdesk-tcp-21116]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 21116
remote_port = 21116

[rustdesk-udp-21116]
type = udp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 21116
remote_port = 21116

[rustdesk-tcp-21117]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 21117
remote_port = 21117

[rustdesk-tcp-21118]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 21118
remote_port = 21118

[rustdesk-tcp-21119]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 21119
remote_port = 21119
```

If you want the **internal host A** to receive WAN connections, we need to set the ID server of the **internal host A** to the cloud server IP (the cloud server's IP is the public IP, which will receive requests and forward them to the Raspberry Pi).

Of course, the host initiating control from the WAN must also set the external IP to initiate control.

![image-20230912135153485](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1694497914409R6QyH826.png)

If the **host initiating control** is in the home LAN environment, the **ID server** can be set to the internal IP of the Raspberry Pi or to the **public IP of the cloud server**.

## Why not directly run the rustdesk service on a server instead of on a Raspberry Pi?

rustdesk has two services, hbbs is responsible for verification and signature, and hbbr is responsible for forwarding remote control data packets.

![170487506-8ef1f025-ad42-47f9-8d82-b49d0ec759ad](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1694498376154G7B1thhS.png)

In the settings interface, we only filled in the hbbs information (ID server), and without filling in hbbr information, hbbr will automatically decide whether to go through the public network traffic.

If our **controlled host** and **host initiating control** are both on the internal network, they will directly use the internal network traffic, which will be an incredibly smooth experience.

Of course, whether the host initiating control or the controlled host, once they leave the LAN, they will automatically go through cloud server traffic forwarding.

## So, How Should the ID Server be Filled?

As long as you are on an external network, both the controlling and controlled end, without exception, fill in the external IP!

If you are on an internal network, both the controlling and controlled end can still fill in the external IP; (if both the controlling and controlled devices are simultaneously on an internal network, they will automatically go through internal network traffic, which is extremely smooth).

If a device only wants to be connected by devices on the internal network, then fill in the internal IP!

(The internal IP refers to the Raspberry Pi IP, and the external IP refers to the cloud server IP).

## Conclusion

I've seen some YouTubers turn a Mac mini into a home server. Because of macOS's poor optimization of the VNC protocol, this results in screen tearing, so they reluctantly use SSH to connect to the server. But I feel it's a waste to give up on macOS's smooth animations, so I came up with the Raspberry Pi running open-source rustdesk as a solution.

Although there are other solutions like TeamViewer, ToDesk, Sunflower, etc., they cannot achieve a silky smooth remote desktop experience within the LAN.

This Raspberry Pi rustdesk solution ensures the remote desktop is silky smooth on the LAN and smooth on the WAN, and even without a Raspberry Pi, you can also run a rustdesk server through a virtual machine, giving old MacBook new vigor and brilliance.
