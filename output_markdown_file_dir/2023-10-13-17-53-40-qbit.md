## What are BT and PT, and what's the difference between them?

BT (BitTorrent) and PT (Private Tracker) are two common file-sharing technologies.

BT (BitTorrent): You can think of BitTorrent as a huge jigsaw puzzle exchange market. Suppose you have a very large puzzle that you want to share with others. However, it's too big to send all at once. So, you break it into many small pieces (what's called "chunking"). Then you tell everyone, "Hey, I have this cool puzzle that I've broken down into lots of pieces, and you can come and get them." In this way, people can take one or two pieces from you and then share them with others. Thus, the various parts of the puzzle can quickly spread across the network. This is how BitTorrent basically works.

PT (Private Tracker): PT is like a private puzzle exchange club. You need to be invited or meet certain conditions (e.g., you need to prove that you are willing and able to share puzzles). In this club, puzzle exchanges are strictly tracked. If you just take the pieces of the puzzle without sharing them with others, you might be kicked out of the club. Therefore, PT usually offers higher download speeds and higher quality files because its members are motivated to share.

## What is the magic value on a PT site?

On a PT (Private Tracker) site, **magic value** is an important metric used to measure a user's activity and contribution.

PT hopes its members download as many resources as possible and seed for as long as possible after downloading. This way, other members can enjoy higher download speeds when downloading resources.

After downloading resources, continuous seeding will earn magic value rewards every hour.

Magic value is equivalent to the currency on the PT site, which can be used to reward resources, trade, exchange upload volume (maintaining a certain ratio between upload and download volume is necessary to survive on the PT website), invite friends to join, etc.

The goal of this article is to create a qBittorrent Web version downloader that runs on a home Raspberry Pi, supports public network access to add download tasks, maintains seeding, operates at the lowest electricity cost, and stays online 24/7 to continuously acquire magic value.

The service we build is based on this open source project https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-qbittorrent

## Creating the service

```
# Create a folder to store the downloaded resources (It is recommended to mount the external hard drive to this location to effectively increase the storage limit of the Raspberry Pi)
mkdir /opt/sda1
# Create folder
mkdir /opt/server-qbittorrent
cd /opt/server-qbittorrent
# Create a folder to store the configuration
mkdir /opt/server-qbittorrent/appdata
# Create configuration file
touch /opt/server-qbittorrent/docker-compose.yml
```

Put the following content into the configuration file `docker-compose.yml`

```
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  qbittorrent:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:latest
    container_name: qbittorrent
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - WEBUI_PORT=8080
    volumes:
      - /opt/server-qbittorrent/appdata/config:/config
      - /opt/sda1/pt/downloads:/downloads
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
      - 6881:6881
      - 6881:6881/udp
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start the service (please make sure the 8080 port is available)

```
cd /opt/server-qbittorrent/
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

After the service is successfully launched, the web UI page of the project can be accessed via the LAN IP:8080 port, the default username is `admin`, and the default login password is `adminadmin`

![image-20231014111152494](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1697253113671DMTjGWkh.png)

After entering, you can change the display language, and the login username and password, and remember to save

![image-20231014111447676](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1697253288574nzWXdcsw.png)

If there is no upload speed, it is recommended to set the listening port to random

## Configure public network access

Add port forwarding to the frpc.ini file on the Raspberry Pi, mapping the Raspberry Pi's 8080 port to the server's 8081 port for an example configuration

```
[qbit-8080]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 8080
remote_port = 8081
```

Finally, don’t forget to restart the frpc service on the Raspberry Pi, open the 8081 port on the server, and public network access via Web is possible. Start seeding happily and earn magic value.

## Switching to a larger hard drive

After a week of downloading, I found that the 1TB hard drive was quickly overwhelmed. So I got a 16TB hard drive

- Mount a 16TB hard drive for the Raspberry Pi and support automatic mounting at startup

First, plug the 16TB hard drive into a Raspberry Pi USB 3.0 port, and make sure the `e2fsprogs` package is installed, which includes the `mkfs.ext4` command

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install e2fsprogs
```

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16981327849576srKm8Nx.png)

Then, use the `lsblk` or `fdisk -l` command to check. The device name is usually something like `sda`, `sdb`, etc., here my hard drive's device name is `sdb`
![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1698132785679Wi06G6Xt.png)

Use the `mkfs.ext4` command to format the hard drive. Please note that this will delete all data on the hard drive, so ensure there is no data you need on the drive.

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb
```

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1698132792339kXbYJAHG.png)

Create a mount point. I want it mounted to `/opt/sdb`, so I create this directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/sdb
```

Mount the hard drive to this directory:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdb /opt/sdb
```

To automatically mount at startup, you need to edit the `/etc/fstab` file. First, get the UUID of the hard drive:

```bash
sudo blkid
```

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1698132794788Qjahhr3n.png)

Find the line corresponding to `/dev/sdb` and take note of the UUID.

Use a text editor you prefer to edit the `/etc/fstab` file.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/fstab
```

At the end of the file, add a line like this:

```bash
UUID=6b062b4***************93ddbfe /opt/sdb ext4 defaults 0 0
```

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/16981327983577mRTb1Tw.png)

Save and exit.

Finally, use the `mount -a` command to mount all the file systems defined in `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

Now, the hard drive should be formatted to ext4 and mounted to `/opt/sdb`. Plus, it will automatically mount on every boot.

![image.png](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1698132799246KBbW0GB5.png)

Data migration is also easy. My original hard drive mount point is `/opt/sda1`, and the new hard drive mount point is `/opt/sdb`. Use rsync to migrate, which supports auto-resume if interrupted

```
rsync -ah --progress --delete /opt/sda1/pt/downloads/ /opt/sdb/pt/downloads
```

Enter `/opt/server-qbittorrent` and run the following command to stop the docker service

```
sudo docker-compose stop
```

Modify the configuration file `docker-compose.yml`, changing `- /opt/sda1/pt/downloads:/downloads` to `- /opt/sdb/pt/downloads:/downloads`

Start the docker service again

```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

The Raspberry Pi's USB power supply is not very adequate, and mounting multiple mechanical hard drives can lead to unstable power supply, causing mounts to disconnect. It is generally recoverable by a restart, so it is suggested to use an independently powered hard drive enclosure and to reduce the number of mechanical hard drives mounted.

## Some advanced hard drive space-saving tips

Our 16TB hard drive can serve as a subdirectory for smb service. If you read the 17th issue of the Jellyfin setup tutorial in this series, you can use the smb mount directory of the 16TB hard drive as Jellyfin's media library.

The content downloaded by qBittorrent can be directly hard-linked to the Jellyfin media library directory on the same hard drive—fast speeds, and the hard-linked files will only occupy the space of one file. You can seed in the qBittorrent directory while generating a poster wall in the Jellyfin directory—for example, using `cp -lR` to create a hard link from the qbit download directory to the Jellyfin media library directory

```
cp -lR '/opt/sdb/pt/downloads/[Friends].Friends Season 01-10 NTSC DD5.1 x264/Friends Season 01 NTSC DD5.1 x264-CtrlSD' '/opt/sdb/jellyfin/Shows/Friends (1994) [tmdbid-1668]/Season 1'
```

If you find it troublesome to use `cp -lR` every time, you can also copy two copies directly from the graphical interface. When the disk space is almost full, use `rdfind -makehardlinks true /opt/sdb` to automatically deduplicate identical files and establish hard links, then the space becomes ample again.

## Solving high CPU usage issues with qBittorrent

I noticed after running qbit, the CPU usage of the Raspberry Pi often spiked to over 95%. I looked up related materials and finally found a solution at https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/13530 by changing the 'I/O threads' from its default value of 10 to 4.

![image-20240107143613540](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1704609374089n7YZ7pnj.png)

![image-20240107144902118](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1704610142633t823PrsZ.png)

The solution is shown in the figure below, change the `Asynchronous I/O threads` to 4

![image-20240107143731971](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1704609452846hQ4a0EFk.png)

Don't forget to save after the modification

![image-20240107144147290](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1704609707878mB2rSkrR.png)

If the CPU is still highly utilized after the modification, you can try restarting the service

```
cd /opt/server-qbittorrent
sudo docker-compose restart
```

Even though qbit still consumes a lot of CPU resources after the modification, the CPU load remains within an acceptable range

## Conclusion

BT is a good technology, but the existence of 'leechers', software that only downloads without uploading, turned BT download into a rootless tree, an unending flow.

The PT website, however, formalizes member behavior by registering and recording, and by quantifying sharing behaviors with magic value currency, encourages members to use qBittorrent, a BT protocol-compliant software for long-term seeding. This is a good thing for members who are fond of high-quality resources and fast download speeds.

"Everyone for me, me for everyone" should be the underlying spirit of the Internet.
