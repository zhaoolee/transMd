Recently, zhaoolee acquired a Sony ZV1 M2 camera. This compact camera is small enough to fit in a pocket, significantly increasing the speed of producing photos. This issue, I will be building a photography website running on Raspberry Pi that also supports external access.

Having the Raspberry Pi store these is beneficial as the space is cheap; a 1TB hard drive only costs a few tens of yuan. If accessing the site within a home network, even super large originals can be opened at a very fast speed.

The Raspberry Pi can also open the site to the internet through internal network penetration.

The final effect: https://photography.v2fy.com/

Clicking on the picture displays the large image. In widescreen mode, if the original image retains the shooting parameters, they will be shown in the bottom left corner.

The photography website is based on the Github open-source project https://github.com/rampatra/photography. The open-source project supports running `gulp resize` to crop photography images with one click, putting the images with a width of 1024px as originals in the `images/full` folder and those with a width of 512px as previews in the `images/thumbs` folder.

However, I prefer to keep the most original pictures in `images/full`. After running `gulp resize`, it generates previews based on the pictures in `images/full` and places them into `images/thumbs`. Thus, I rewrote this resize logic, with the code hosted at https://github.com/zhaoolee/photography

The open-source project, photography, is originally built using Github Actions and then hosted with Github Pages to complete the publishing. However, in China, Github Pages' image resources are made inaccessible by the special network.

To adapt to the special network environment, I transformed the project: it's still hosted on Github, but the static site is built locally. The static website resources built are sent to a specific folder on the Raspberry Pi via rsync to complete deployment. At the same time, the project resources are released to the Github repository as a backup.

Additionally, I made some optimizations, placing images in the fulls folder allows real-time generation of previews and real-time display on the webpage. The original version required manual execution of `gulp resize`.

In practice, just place images into the `images/fulls` folder and run `npm run push`, which completes the publishing and creates a backup on Github.

## Get the Project, Install Dependencies

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/zhaoolee/photography.git
cd photography
bundle install
npm install
```

## Run the Project

```
npm run dev
```

Open the browser to `http://127.0.0.1:4000` to view zhaoolee's photography website resources. Delete the image resources inside `images/fulls` and `images/thumbs`, put your own pictures into `images/fulls`, and refresh the browser to see the final result.

## Generate Static Website

```
npm run build
```

After running the above command, all the resources required for the website will be created in the root directory's `_site` folder.

Now, the contents of the `_site` can be hosted with nginx on Raspberry Pi for inner network access.

Create a directory in Nginx to store the static content of `_site`.

```
sudo mkdir /usr/share/nginx/photography.v2fy.com
sudo chown www-data:www-data /usr/share/nginx/photography.v2fy.com
```

As the default user for nginx is `www-data`, we create a folder belonging to `www-data` for Nginx to use.

![image-20231018151304146](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1697613184538kr7XY2cf.png)

Create a new file ending with `.conf` in the `etc/nginx/conf.d` directory of the Raspberry Pi, such as `photography.v2fy.com.conf`, and insert the following content:

```
server {
    listen 8084;
    server_name photography.v2fy.com 127.0.0.1  192.168.50.10;

    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/photography.v2fy.com;
        index index.html index.htm;
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    error_page 404 /404.html;
    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
}
```

Then use rsync to transfer the `_site` contents to `/usr/share/nginx/photography.v2fy.com`. Example command:

```
rsync -avvz --update --no-perms --chown=www-data:www-data --delete ./_site/  root@frp:/usr/share/nginx/photography.v2fy.com/
```

After transferring, restart nginx:

```
sudo nginx -t
sudo nginx -s reload
```

Now we can access the photography site using the internal network.

![image-20231018151723132](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1697613443960ysnTQj3i.png)

Add the following configuration to the frpc.ini on Raspberry Pi to map the local 8084 to cloud server's 8084:

```
[photography]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 8084
remote_port = 8084
```

In the server-side Nginx configuration file `/etc/nginx/conf.d/photography.v2fy.com.conf`:

```
upstream photography_v2fy_com { server 127.0.0.1:8084; }

server {
    server_name      photography.v2fy.com;
    listen           80;

    #rewrite ^(.*)$ https://$host$1 permanent;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://photography_v2fy_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:80;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}

server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  photography.v2fy.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://photography_v2fy_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    ssl_certificate "/etc/nginx/ssl/photography.v2fy.com/fullchain.cer";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/nginx/ssl/photography.v2fy.com/photography.v2fy.com.key";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.

    error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /40x.html {
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
    }
}
```

After the certificate configuration is complete, restart the server-side Nginx!

## Summary

As mobile photography becomes increasingly powerful and camera manufacturers intensify competition, consumers buying in large numbers will also defray R&D costs. We can buy great cameras at a very low price and enjoy the fun of photography, while a Raspberry Pi photography website allows us to showcase our work on the internet at an extremely low cost.

If you are someone who loves photography, an independent photography website can add a touch of professionalism to your hobby. Consistently updating your own photography site, learning about photography, and reviewing past photos, can also provide deeper insight into the craft.
