title: "Raspberry Pi No Dust" Issue #24: Laziness is the Primary Productive Force, Installing the Visual Open Source Management Panel 1Panel on Raspberry Pi
categories:
- Raspberry Pi No Dust / Use Pi
---

Recently, a buddy recommended a modern Linux open source management panel, 1Panel, which is open source and stable. Laziness is the primary productive force. Although the command line is very flexible, a graphical interface is really a must-have for lazy people. In this issue, we deploy 1Panel on Raspberry Pi, making Linux O&M on Raspberry Pi more effortless and further lowering the barrier to Raspberry Pi usage.

## Installing 1Panel

```
curl -sSL https://resource.fit2cloud.com/1panel/package/quick_start.sh -o quick_start.sh && sudo bash quick_start.sh
```

If we directly access port 38414, we will be prompted with no permission. It's necessary to access the complete path including routing. If you forget the access path, simply enter `1pctl user-info` in the Raspberry Pi terminal to check.

On the homepage, we can see the current operating status of Raspberry Pi, as well as system information. The CPU utilization is at 90%, and memory utilization is at 60%. Raspberry Pi is being squeezed quite appropriately by zhaoolee, indeed no dust collection! (Raspberry Pi: Thank you!)

We can also check the running status of various Docker containers through the Containers menu.

## Download Server Files to Local through the Browser

We can directly download files from Raspberry Pi to the local machine through the browser.

## Use ssh in the Browser

We can use terminal command lines directly through the browser to control Raspberry Pi.

## Install Software through the App Store

1Panel also has a very convenient feature, which is to install various environments and open-source projects with one click. Here we demonstrate installing a NetEase Cloud third-party client, YouPlayMusic.

After clicking install, a panel will confirm the information. For the convenience of the demonstration, we allow external access.

Following the prompts in the image above, we can access port 40075 to see yesplaymusic running on Raspberry Pi.

## Map 1Panel to the Public Network

If you want to access your Raspberry Pi through 1Panel from any place with an internet connection, you can employ traditional skills and use frp to map 1Panel to the public internet. Considering security, I will use https encryption to forward the access of https://1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/ to the Raspberry Pi's port 38414 at home.

First, add the following configuration to Raspberry Pi's frpc.ini, and restart the Raspberry Pi's frpc service to make it effective.

```
[1panel-fangyuanxiaozhan-com-38414]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 38414
remote_port = 38414
```

Then add the configuration file `/etc/nignx/conf.d/1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com.conf` on the cloud server.

```
upstream 1panel_fangyuanxiaozhan_com { server 127.0.0.1:38414; }

server {
  server_name      1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com;
  listen           80;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://1panel_fangyuanxiaozhan_com;
    proxy_set_header Host $host:80;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  }
}
```

## Apply for a Certificate with acme

```
domain="1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com"
# Request a certificate
acme.sh --issue -d $domain --nginx /etc/nginx/conf.d/$domain.conf
# Create a folder
mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl/$domain/
# Install the certificate
acme.sh --install-cert -d $domain \
--key-file       /etc/nginx/ssl/$domain/$domain.key  \
--fullchain-file  /etc/nginx/ssl/$domain/fullchain.cer \
--reloadcmd     "service nginx force-reload"
```

Replace the contents of `/etc/nignx/conf.d/1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com.conf` with the following content

```
upstream 1panel_fangyuanxiaozhan_com { server 127.0.0.1:38414; }

server {
    server_name      1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com;
    listen           80;

    rewrite ^(.*)$ https://$host$1 permanent;

}

server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://1panel_fangyuanxiaozhan_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    ssl_certificate "/etc/nginx/ssl/1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/fullchain.cer";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/nginx/ssl/1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/1panel.fangyuanxiaozhan.com.key";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.

    error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /40x.html {
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
    }
}
```
Finally, restart the server-side nginx
```
nginx -s reload
```

Access 1panel from the public network through a browser.

## Summary

If you want to keep an eye on the operation of your Raspberry Pi at all times, 1Panel is a good choice. It's open source and free, makes full use of Docker's features, and allows you to configure various environments and install various software with a single click.
