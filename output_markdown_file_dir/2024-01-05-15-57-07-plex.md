Plex and Jellyfin offer similar functions; Jellyfin is an open-source free software, whereas Plex is paid software (free features are quite limited). If you're reluctant to pay, Jellyfin is recommended, as it has added a plethora of techniques for managing movie and TV resources. Jellyfin's database is compatible with Plex's, and it's recommended to finish reading Issue #17 before proceeding with this issue's content [Raspberry Pi Issue #17: Building an Open-Source Free Jellyfin Private Cinema with Raspberry Pi and a More Powerful Spare Laptop](https://v2fy.com/p/2023-06-10-jellyfin-1686388142000/)

## Where Does the Paid Version of Plex Excel Over the Free, Open-Source Jellyfin?

- Plex can automatically match lyrics for songs and has a dedicated mobile app for music listening.
- Plex can match posters for various improperly named movie and TV resources and can share a database folder with Jellyfin without migration costs.
- Plex supports skipping the intro and outro of TV shows with one click.
- Once logged in to Plex, you can view the content of the resource library via the official service without any network penetration configuration (though the bandwidth is very small).
- Plex is ready to use out of the box, with automatic hardware decoding enabled, and no strange bugs.
- Plex can turn a PS5 from useless to priceless (as PS5 is capable of downloading the Plex client).

## About Plex

**Plex is a buyout-supported software**, zhaoolee got the lifetime version for $89 during Black Friday, and feels it's still worth it. This article is based on the premium version of Plex.

**Plex is divided into client and server**, we can **run the Plex server on an old computer**, which supports adding local movie and TV resource folders. After adding folders, the Plex server will automatically identify the video resources and create the corresponding poster wall, **Plex clients can be run on web browsers, as well as on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Ps5, and various TV boxes**.

**The Plex server can automatically record the viewing progress of each user on the client side and transcode the video resources in real-time**. For example, if mkv format video resources cannot be played in the browser client, the Plex server will automatically convert mkv video resources into a format that can be played by the browser and stream it to the browser client. I have stored 4K video resources in the Plex media library, and when I use my iPhone on a 5G network to watch the film, I want to save data by playing at 720p, and the Plex server can transcode 4K movies to 720p and stream them to the iOS client in real-time.

The focus of this article is to use the Raspberry Pi as a gateway to map the local Plex server to the public network. Plex is paid software with extremely simple installation, which will not be elaborated on in this article.

## My Solution

The performance of Raspberry Pi is too weak, not strong enough to transcode 4K movies in real-time. My solution is to run the Plex server program on the old computer at home, while the Raspberry Pi is responsible for penetrating the internal network and forwarding Plex client requests to the Plex server.

Hardware list:

- A cloud server with a public IP (provides an entry point for external access via a public IP)
- Raspberry Pi (as a gateway, responsible for internal network penetration, forwarding Plex client traffic to Plex server)
- A more powerful computer (running the Plex server, an old MacBook Pro is sufficient)
- A router that can connect the Raspberry Pi and the old computer.

Software list:

- The cloud server uses Nginx to forward traffic, directing requests received at port 443 for `plex.fangyuanxiaozhan.com` to port 32400 on the cloud server. The cloud server also runs frps, which is used to receive requests from frpc.
- Raspberry Pi runs frpc, linking port 32400 of the Raspberry Pi with port 32400 of the cloud server, so when the cloud server's port 32400 receives a request, Raspberry Pi's port 32400 will get the request, and the Raspberry Pi runs Nginx to forward the requests received at port 32400 to the Plex server.
- MacBook Pro runs Plex's server and processes requests through port 32400, using MacBook to decode the video resources on demand.

## Cloud Server Configuration:

The frps on the cloud server doesn't need much configuration. The Nginx on the cloud server needs to add a configuration file `/etc/nginx/conf.d/plex.fangyuanxiaozhan.com.conf`, which receives requests from `plex.fangyuanxiaozhan.com` and forwards them to port 32400.
```
upstream plex_fangyuanxiaozhan_com { server 127.0.0.1:32400; }

server {
    server_name      flex.fangyuanxiaozhan.com;
    listen           80;

    rewrite ^(.*)$ https://$host$1 permanent;

}

server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  plex.fangyuanxiaozhan.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://plex_fangyuanxiaozhan_com;
        proxy_set_header Host $host:443;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    ssl_certificate "/etc/nginx/ssl/plex.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/fullchain.cer";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/nginx/ssl/plex.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/plex.fangyuanxiaozhan.com.key";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.

    error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /40x.html {
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
    }
}
```


## Raspberry Pi Configuration:

The Raspberry Pi runs frpc to receive requests from port 32400 of the cloud server, just add the following code to the Raspberry Pi's frpc.ini file:
```
[plex-fangyuanxiaozhan-com-32400]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 32400
remote_port = 32400
```

Raspberry Pi Nginx configuration, my Raspberry Pi's IP in the internal network is `192.168.50.10`, and the IP of the MacBook Pro that runs the Plex server is `192.168.50.74`, I installed Nginx on the Raspberry Pi, and added configuration file `/etc/nginx/conf.d/192.168.50.74-32400.conf` whose content is to forward all requests received on the Raspberry Pi's port 32400 to the MacBook Pro's port 32400, so the Plex server can receive external requests.
```
server {
    listen 32400;
    server_name 192.168.50.10;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.50.74:32400;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}

```

After completing the configuration, you can access the Plex service via your own domain name from the external network.

## Plex Server Configuration

If you want Plex's iOS and macOS clients to use your own frp to forward traffic to access the Plex server, the following configuration is required.

![image-20240106165013299](https://cdn.fangyuanxiaozhan.com/assets/1704531014980BMccQC60.png)

There is a huge pitfall in Plex server configuration. If you want to forward traffic through your own server with internal network penetration, do not check `Enable Relay`; otherwise, Plex will use the official default proxy channel, which is very slow and often fails to connect to the Plex server.

If your cloud server does not have an independent domain name, replace `https://plex.fangyuanxiaozhan.com:443` with `http://ip-address:port-number`.

Verification (not required): After completing the configuration, you can use some network analysis tools to see that the Plex client can make data requests via `plex.fangyuanxiaozhan.com` on a 5G network.

## What Can Plex Do After Supporting Public Network Access Through Raspberry Pi?

- Plex is a powerful tool for binging video courses, allowing seamless playback of video courses on various devices, and the iPhone client for Plex can keep voice playback in the background after the phone screen is locked.
- You can watch high-quality, uncut movie and TV resources anytime, anywhere.
- Using your own public IP server traffic, you can share the resources on your hard drive with friends and say goodbye to rogue network disks that delete resources.
- You can play audio and video resources on your home hard drive at any time and place using Infuse.
